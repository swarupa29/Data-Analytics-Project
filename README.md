## About the Dataset
The dataset consists of 8 csv files:  

### Glossary
* Credit: Small loan of fixed amount to be paid back later
* Annuity: A payment made at fixed intervals
* Cash Loan: A quick loan requiring minimal documentation
* POS: Point of Sales (Time and place of transaction)

### `application_train.csv`/`application_test.csv`: 
Consists of the target column and other application data of the current applicant. Indexed by `SK_ID_CUR`
which is the unique ID given to each loan application (One row -> One loan).
This ID can also be used to index the column by same name in the following tables
- bureau.csv
- previous_application.csv,
- POS_CASH_balance.csv, 
- credit_card_balance.csv, 
- installments_payments.csv
  
### `bureau.csv`:
Past data from Credit Bureau (An organisation in the US responsible for collecting information to help creditors and lendors. Data is given to it voluntarily and thus the data is not complete).\ One row represents one credit. Can be indexed by `SK_ID_BUREAU`

### `bureau_balance.csv`:
Monthly balance of previous credits in the Credit Bureau.\
One row for each month of credit data in each row in bureau.csv. `SK_ID_BUREAU` references the corresponding row in bureau.csv

### `POS_CASH_balance.csv`:
Monthly balance snapshots of previous POS (point of sales) and cash loans that the applicant had with Home Credit.\
One row for each month of history of every previous credit in Home Credit (consumer credit and cash loans) related to loans.

### `Credit_card_balance.csv`:
Monthly balance snapshots of previous credit cards that the applicant has with Home Credit.\
One row for each month of history of every previous credit in Home Credit.

### `previous_application.csv`:
Details of previous loan applications at Home Credit.\
One row one application related to loans.

### `installments_payments.csv`:
Repayment history of previous disbursed loans.\
One row for each payment made of payment missed.

### `HomeCredit_columns_description.csv`:
Description of all the columns used in the dataset.

## Description of folders and files in the repository
 1. Version1 - This folder contains all the code for our first try in modelling the dataset.
 2. outputs - This folder contains all the output csv generated by the Level 0 models on train data (final-train-ds.csv), a folder of all predictions of L0 models on test data (test prediction) and the prediction of the final model which was submitted to kaggle (final-prediction.csv).
 3. EDA - This file has the jupyter notebook to the exploratory data analysis and preprocessing
 4. FinalVersion - This folder contains the kaggle notebooks which contains the final model for the data. This consists of 2 files:\
  a. Level0 models - This contains the code which is used to select the level 1 model. We compare 3 models and choose LightGBM as the best model.\
  b. Ensemble model - This is the final model code which consists of training each of the tables using level 0 models, predictions on train and test data, using that to train the level 1 model and hence get the final prediction on test data which was then submitted to kaggle.
 5. Final report - This pdf is the final paper for the project
 6. Plagarism report - This is the plagarism report for the paper submitted. The similarity score is 4%.

  Note: Since the dataset is very large and cannot be uploaded to github even after zipping, we are attaching the link to the dataset. We have also attached the links to the kaggle notebooks used for the models. They can be run on edit mode to reproduce results easily. But the notebook has few private data files which is the predictions of the level 0 models on train and test data.

## Summary of Kernel
We have used a form of stacking ensemble model for predicting the target values. Each table is trained on a seperate LightGBM model (Level 0 models) and its predictions are used to train the ANN (Level 1 model) which gives the final predictions.

### EDA
Columns having in excess of 70% data missing was dropped. \
Categorical values were imputed with mode. Quantitative variables were imputed using ridge regression. Checked for skew in the data, and balanced it. \
Visualization : Checked for distribution, relation of data via density plots, normal plots and box plots to check for outliers. Catplot of features for each target class.\
PCA and Dimensionality Reduction : Standardised all variables, with total variance at 90%. Shape reduced from 89 to 47.

### Level 0 Model
Each table of the dataset is trained parallely. LightGBM was used as the performance was highly dependent upon feature engineering of each table.

ROCAUC Scores of the tables

  | Table name   | Train data | Public LB | Private LB |
  | ------------ | ---------- | --------- | ---------- |
  | Cred bal     | 0.664      | 0.576     | 0.568      |   
  | Installments | 0.803      | 0.641     | 0.629      |  
  | POS data     | 0.756      | 0.599     | 0.595      |   
  | Bureau       | 0.809      | 0.660     | 0.664      |   
  | Prev appl    | 0.844      | 0.666     | 0.676      |    
  | Appl train   | 0.800      | 0.724     | 0.718      |    


### Level 1 Model
Combine predictions of L0 models and give final prediction.\
Each table had varying influence on the target variable, hence a simple ANN is used.\
ROCAUC Score - Train data : 0.91

### Final
ROCAUC Score - Public LB : 0.75, Private LB : 0.74
